            <h3>Why Texas is Better Than California? A Tale of Two States!</h3>

            <h4>Texas Dethrones California!</h4>

            <p>
                Texas is clearly faring way better than California,
                making life easier for the people with its incredible housing, affordable living (better score in cost of living),
                ease of commute and internet accessibility. All amazing stuff which makes Texas
                your next home!

        <div id="two_div" class="border border-dark rounded bg-light shadow-sm text-center">
            <h4>California Still Rules!</h4>
            <svg id="two_svg"></svg>
            <p>
                Texas is in no way in competition with California. California is and will continue to be
                the destination for thousands of people looking to make it their home with its higher safety,
                better access to education and greater scope of business for your dreams to come true!

            <h3 class="text-center">About the Debate</h3>
            <p>
                With over one-fifth of the American population residing in either Texas or California, these 
                two states hold the top spots for being the most densely populated states in the country.
                Choosing between Texas and California can be a challenging decision as they both offer exceptional 
                weather, stunning landscapes, and a wide range of exciting activities. However, recent trends have 
                shown that Texas has experienced rapid growth, making it one of the fastest-growing states in the U.S., 
                while California has grown at a slower rate than the national average. Some portion of the people tend
                to prefer Texas now while others still swear by California. <br>
                A dataset related to the quality of life has been used to make the arguments.
                Link to the dataset: <a
                    href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/orhankaramancode/city-quality-of-life-dataset"
                    target="_blank">https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/orhankaramancode/city-quality-of-life-dataset.</a> <br>
                This dataset was obtained from Teleport API endpoints ( <a href="https://developers.teleport.org/api/" target="_blank">https://developers.teleport.org/api/</a>)
                and pre-processed before being uploaded to Kaggle. Teleport.org aggregates its data sources and computes 
                scores for urban areas (Teleport Cities) across various different categories. <br> <br>
                
                The left visualization shows a <b>Spider/Radar chart</b> which compares both Texas and California
                on their quality of life on the basis of few selected parameters like Housing, Ease of Living,
                Travel Connectivity, Commute and Internet Access. <br>
                The rhetorical techniques used in the chart are: <br>
                - <b>Simplification:</b> The dataset provided the values of each category city-wise. The data has been
                simplified by aggregating city-wise data into state to visualize comparison between states.
                to frame the argument. <br>
                - <b>Omission</b>: Some categories in which California is better has been omitted to persuade
                the user that Texas is way better.  <br>
                - <b>Anchoring: </b>The left chart directs the viewer's attention by highlighting the better qualities of Texas
                in the Radar chart so that the values of those categories for California seem much smaller in comparison. <br>
                - <b>Comparison:</b> The radar chart shows a clear comparison between Texas and California based on certain features and color coding,
                and its visualized in a way that helps the user to interpret the contrasting difference in a single look. <br>
                - <b>Axis Scaling:</b> The axes have been scaled in the left Radar chart to make the difference between both
                the states appear more distinctive. <br>
                - <b>Filtering: </b>The data has been fitered to show only the few necessary features which show Texas is better.

                <br>
                <br>
                The right visualization shows a <b>Grouped Bar Chart</b> which compares both Texas and California
                on their quality of life on the basis of few selected parameters like Venture Capital, 
                Safety, Education, Tolerance and Startups. <br>

                The rhetorical techniques used in the chart are: <br>
                - <b>Simplification: </b>The dataset which had values of each category city-wise has been normalized on the scale of 1 to 10.
                The data has been simplified and then aggregated to show it state-wise
                and drive a point home, which is that California is still better. <br>
                - <b>Omission: </b>Some categories in which values for Texas is better have been omitted to persuade
                the user that California is still way better. <br>
                - <b>Axis Scaling:</b> The axes of the bar chart have been scaled in the right chart to make the contrast
                easily distinguishable. <br>
                - <b>Anchoring: </b> The right chart directs the viewer's attention by showing the bad qualities of Texas 
                with respect to California side by side so that user is forced to make a comparison. <br>
                - <b>Comparison: </b>The grouped bar chart shows a clear comparison between Texas and California based on selected features
                and its visualized in a way such that values of same categories for California seem much higher in comparison and its also color coded. <br>
                - <b>Filtering: </b>The data has been fitered to show only selected features in which California's ratings are higher. <br>
